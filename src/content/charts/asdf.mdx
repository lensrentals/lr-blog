        This makes a good second lens to show you because the version II is
        noticeably sharper than the original version at 70mm and 135mm. You can
        tell the difference if you shoot with them, so this gives you a good
        ‘this much difference is significant’ comparison for the other MTF
        charts. It is better at 200mm, but more at the ‘you’d have to make a
        careful direct comparison to see a difference’ level.
